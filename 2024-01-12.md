## Syntax and Notation
- Haskell syntax avoids parens by default
- No commas
- Function calls do not have parens
  - `f a` instead of `f(a)`
  - `f a b` instead of `f(a,b)`
- Partial application is more natural
  - In Haskell
    - `f : a -> b -> c`
    - `f a : b -> c` you can partially apply a
    - `f a b : c` or you can give both args at once
    - the implementation of `f` is the same for both
  - In TS
    - `function f(a: A, b: B) => C`
    - `f(a, b): C`
    - `f(a)`
    - `function f2(a: A) => (b: B) => C`
  - Haskell notation gives you currying for free
- Infix vs prefix operator notation
  - a . b = (.) a b
  - If an operator is infix, surround with parens to make it prefix
  - f a b = a `f` b
  - If an operator is prefix, surround with `` to make it infix

## Functor Law Proofs
Why did `f b` becomes `f a` in fmap identity proof
- Because replace the `(a -> b)` type with the instance `id` forces `a` and `b` to become the same thing

## Parser.optional
Maybe is a Functor
- Can it implement fmap that adheres to the laws?
maybeMap : (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b

Parser is a Functor
  Parser has a map
Either<A,B> is a BiFunctor
ParserResult<A> is an alias for Either<ParserError, ParserSuccess<A>>
  Either<ParserError, ParserSuccess<A>> has a map
  aka ParserResult.mapSuccess
ParserSuccess<A> is a functor
  ParserSuccess has a map
When `optional` is mapping A to Maybe<A>, it's drilling down to ultimately use ParserSuccess's map to transform the data

## Homework
1a. Carefully step through the derivations of the identity and composition proofs for fmap
1b. Try proving the Functor laws for a few specific Functors (Maybe, Promise, List, ...)
2. Why are these laws necessary for fmap? What happens if they are broken? Can you come up with something Functor-like with an fmap that doesn't obey the laws? (hint: think about mapping over a list)
3. Is Functor identity law required for composition? (hint: only one is necessary)
4. Deeply trace through the applications of Functor and fmap and how it's used throughout Parser.optional at various layers
5. Look through the new utils we added to make the `or` branch of `optional` work

## Next Time
Start looking at `or`
